    "### Basic Bookstore Management<br>\n",
    "In this task, you will apply your Python skills to solve problems that a small bookstore might face. This exercise will help you understand how programming can be used in business scenarios to automate and streamline various operations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Imagine you are helping to manage a small, local bookstore. Your responsibilities include keeping track of the books in stock, managing sales transactions, updating inventory, and making decisions based on the store's budget. To make these tasks easier and more efficient, you decide to write a Python program that can handle these activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program will need to perform several key functions related to managing the bookstore:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adding New Books to Inventory\n",
    "    * When new books arrive, you need to add them to your inventory system. This includes details like the title, author, price, and quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculating Sales Prices\n",
    "    * When a customer buys books, you need to calculate the total price, including applying discounts: Buying 2 gets 5% off; buying 3 or more gets 10% off.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Updating Book Stock\n",
    "    * After a sale, the quantity of the sold books in the inventory needs to be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Searching for Books\n",
    "    * Customers might ask if a certain book is available. You should be able to search for a book by its title.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Displaying Books Within a Budget\n",
    "    * Sometimes customers have a specific budget. You want to quickly show them all the books available within their budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Removing Books from Inventory\n",
    "    * If a book is no longer available for sale (e.g., out of print), it should be removed from the inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Estimating Future Profit\n",
    "    * Calculate the estimated profit based on the current inventory. For each book in the inventory, the profit is calculated by taking the sale price, subtracting 30% of the sale price (which is considered the cost), and then multiplying by the quantity in stock. The total estimated profit is the sum of the profit from each book in the inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Simple Menu for Operations\n",
    "    * To make the system user-friendly, create a simple text-based menu that allows you to choose and perform these different operations easily."
